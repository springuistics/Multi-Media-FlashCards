# Multi-Media-FlashCards
Mutli-media Flash Cards for the Tohoku University English Curriculum

This is the code for Multi-media Flashcards created to help students at Tohoku University study the words and phrases as prescribed in Pathways to Academic English, 3rd Edition.

The template file is used to create more sets. If other universities / individuals choose to create similar flashcards, I recommend starting from the template. Check other features of particular flashcard sets and add them to yours as you like.

Index.html simply provides an index for the flashcard sets.

Currently, the data for each flash card set is simply housed as a JSON object in the javascript itself. Open to suggestions if anyone has a better idea to combine sets.
